Created:
1	htmlchunks.php
2	htmlchunks.php : pageHeader($Title)
3	/libs/
4	/libs/java/
5	/libs/java/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
6	/libs/php/

Reasons:
1	This will hold mostly static chunks of html, such as the header and footer.
2	This will be where we will define the header for all the pages on our website.
	Since this will be a relatively simple website, shouldn't need to have different
	css or javascript libraries for individual pages.
3	The libs folder will be where we store all php and javascript libraries 
4	The java folder will be where we store all javascript related libraries
5	This is the latest jquery library
6	The php folder will be where we store all php related libraries

Renamed:
1	header.php -> default.php

Reasons:
1	all webpages need a default.php, the orginal intent of header.php has been moved to htmlchunks.php

2:56pm -----------------

Created:
1	htmlchunks.php : newScript($Location)
2	htmlchunks.php : nweCss($Location)
3	css/core.css

Reasons:
1	This will simplify the creation of new libraries.
2	This will simplify the linking of css files to the page.
3	This is the core css file that will be applied to all pages

Deleted:
1	htmlchunks.php : pageHeader($Title='Title')

Reasons:
1	I've decided that this should be done manually on the website.
