Added:
1	/libs/java/slick-nav/
2		^jquery.slicknav.js
3		^jquery.slicknav.min.js
4		^MIT-LICENSE.txt
5		^README.md
6		^slicknav.css

Reasons:
1-6	slick-nav looks like it will make navigation menus easy

Modified:
1	navigation.php : createNav()
2	index.php

Reason:
1	Using the menu template from slicknav.com to test out slick-nav
2	Moved the core.css to be the last loaded so that it overides everything else.

Deleted:
1	/History/History.log

Reasons:
1	Decided not to use it, will just keep track of beforePush.log

Thoughts:
1	Nav Menu needs to have a style applied to it for tablet display and desktop display.
