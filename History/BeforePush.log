Modified:
1	index.php
2	navigation.php
3	readme.txt

Reasons:
1	Added jquery Mobile to index.php, playing around with it to see what we can do with it
2	Removed the array, going to use the jQuery Mobile navigation bar.  See readme for details on Nav Bars.
3	Added a jquery Mobile basics link, a great read on it.

Created:
1	navigation.php : newPageLink($href, $label)
2	navigation.php : createNave()

Reasons:
1	This function will quickly create a new list item
2	This will echo all of the navigation html
