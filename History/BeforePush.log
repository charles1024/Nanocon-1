Created:
1	htmlchunks.php : newScript($Location)
2	htmlchunks.php : nweCss($Location)
3	css/core.css

Reasons:
1	This will simplify the creation of new libraries.
2	This will simplify the linking of css files to the page.
3	This is the core css file that will be applied to all pages

Deleted:
1	htmlchunks.php : pageHeader($Title='Title')

Reasons:
1	I've decided that this should be done manually on the website.
